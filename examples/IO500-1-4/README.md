# IO500-1-4

This example Lustre deployment is based on the specifications in [NAG and DDN's Cloud Native Lustre Filesystem that made the IO500](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hpc/google-cloud-ranks-on-io500-benchmark-with-lustre). We use the same machine specifications and configurations but deploy only 1 MDS/MGS node and 4 OSS nodes (the "1-4").
